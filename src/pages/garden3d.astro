		<h2>Why Am I Applying?</h2>
		<p>
			I‚Äôm applying because of all the content you‚Äôve shared online and how openly you show how
			things work at your company. It started with me reading and nodding along. By the end, I was
			full-on head banging.
		</p>
		<p>
			It‚Äôs a real letdown and bugbear of mine that we spend the lions' share of our waking lives in
			workplaces that so often starve us of the things that make life worthwhile: creativity,
			community, purpose, and joy. Sure, everything‚Äôs a spectrum. Some places are better than
			others. But too often even the <em>good</em> ones often miss the mark because they confuse <em
				>on paper</em
			> corporate lip service and buzzwords for real culture.
		</p>
		<p>
			This happens because they haven‚Äôt done the work of truly figuring out what they stand for,
			what their identity is, their ethics and moral customs, its philosophies that motivate and
			steer and the politics that guide it. It‚Äôs rare enough for an individual to do that kind of
			deep, sweeping, identity work. It‚Äôs even rarer for a company to lift the veil and do it
			honestly. That‚Äôs why so many fail to create cultures that actually mean what they say, ones
			that walk the talk.
		</p>
		<p>
			What excited me about garden3d is that, from all impressions, it <em>has</em> done that work, that
			raw soul searching. I thought: <em
				>this is a place that gets it, where so many others don't</em
			>. A group that‚Äôs had the hard, confronting and honest conversations and come out the other
			side with something clear and real: a <a

				class="kwicherbelliaken-link underline-offset-2 sm:py-0 sm:hover:underline"
				data-astro-prefetch
				target="_blank">moral compass</a
			>, a <a
				href="https://garden3d.substack.com/p/garden3d-dei-report-2024"
				class="kwicherbelliaken-link underline-offset-2 sm:py-0 sm:hover:underline"
				data-astro-prefetch
				target="_blank">commitment to maturing with your values</a
			>. When I read what you‚Äôve shared publicly, it felt like a beacon for people like me who‚Äôve
			been missing that kind of clarity and authenticity.
		</p>
		<p>
			I value many of the same things you do. It amazes me that most workplaces don't practice these
			values, if not for the sole and selfish benefit of their bottom line. Because surprise,
			surprise: when people aren‚Äôt treated like just another resource to be bought and spent, when
			they feel respected, heard, and empowered to bring ideas, voice concerns, and speak honestly
			without fear of being shut down, they care more. And when people care, the quality of their
			work reflects that.
		</p>
		<p>
			This mindset‚Äîthis commitment to capital T Trust‚Äîruns through everything you write. You say the
			only way to get people to truly care is to give them ‚Äúautonomy, respect, and real ownership
			over the work they do,‚Äù and that comes through clearly in <a
				href="https://garden3d.substack.com/p/managing-is-a-makers-skill"
				class="kwicherbelliaken-link underline-offset-2 sm:py-0 sm:hover:underline"
				data-astro-prefetch
				target="_blank"><em>Managing is a Maker‚Äôs Skill</em></a
			>, where you explain why you hire <a
				href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1430-hire-managers-of-one"
				class="kwicherbelliaken-link underline-offset-2 sm:py-0 sm:hover:underline"
				data-astro-prefetch
				target="_blank">‚Äúmanagers of one.‚Äù</a
			> You trust people to handle ambiguity, solve problems, and make decisions, and because of that,
			they take ownership, raise their standards, and genuinely care. And when people care, the work
			is better. The same ethos shows up in how you approach <a
				href="https://garden3d.substack.com/p/distributed"
				class="kwicherbelliaken-link underline-offset-2 sm:py-0 sm:hover:underline"
				data-astro-prefetch
				target="_blank">distributed work</a
			>: people are expected to take responsibility and speak up, not be micromanaged. Disagreements
			are welcomed, not shut down. Transparency is not a nice to have, it is core to how you
			operate. You have built a place where people can work independently, communicate openly, and
			be trusted to do great work. That is rare, and it does not happen by accident.
		</p>

		<h2>What is my Experience?</h2>
		<p>
			I‚Äôve spent most of my career in small B2B SaaS startups, with a short stint at a digital
			agency. It‚Äôs meant taking on the full spectrum of responsibilities, a full wardrobe of hats,
			and being all-across the technology stack. I've taken full ownership of features from
			discovery to delivery. I have had to do it all and do it well.
		</p>
		<p>
			This has included designing and shaping up software solutions, codifying them into
			specifications, communicating with stakeholders, fielding functional requirements, separating
			nice-to-haves from must-haves, and defining delivery constraints (like variable scope and
			fixed time). I‚Äôve run risk analyses, unpacked dependencies and trade-offs, identified feedback
			points (like early beta releases), shaped timelines, and worked out who we need feedback from,
			and what we need it on.
		</p>
		<p>
			I‚Äôve planned and phased work, chunked it into meaningful units, and sketched out broad-stroke
			architecture. I've implemented it: dividing into tasks, working in sprints, and incrementally
			moving toward the bigger vision. I‚Äôve helped make sure decisions are reversible (two-way
			doors), so we can pivot when needed, because software always involves the unknown, and it‚Äôs
			better to prototype and adapt than to believe everything can be planned up front.
		</p>
		<p>
			I‚Äôve handled deployments of serverless stacks (AWS CloudFormation abstractions), managed CI/CD
			pipelines, monitored customer friction and difficulties using telemetry tools like New Relic
			and FullStory, and driven engagement with platforms like Intercom. On the frontend, I‚Äôve
			shipped modern web apps using React, TypeScript, React Query, and Tailwind, with mature
			testing practices built around React Testing Library and Mock Service Worker.
		</p>
		<p>
			Mentoring has been a regular part of my job. I did this primarily through pair programming,
			where I placed a strong emphasis on developing a shared understanding. For me, it was crucial
			that we didn‚Äôt proceed unless everyone involved felt comfortable and confident in their grasp
			of the problem space. I focused less on the implementation details, the how, and more on the
			why: the reasoning, constraints, and trade-offs that shaped the work. When you achieve
			alignment at that level, there‚Äôs far less need to actively manage delivery because the team is
			already moving toward a shared vision. That clarity eliminates a lot of wasted time and
			miscommunication later down the line.
		</p>
		<p>
			I have a lot of experience operating in high-trust, self-managing environments, with real
			ownership over the final product. From interpreting the business need to setting the padding
			on the button.
		</p>

		<h2>What Goals Do I Have?</h2>
		<p>
			It‚Äôs hard to put a label on it, but if I had to, I‚Äôd say I want to become an expert in
			delivering joy through digital experiences. I know that sounds vague. But every now and then,
			you come across a digital experience that genuinely delights you, and it‚Äôs no accident. Those
			moments are designed, engineered, and intentional. I want to get better at that, study it,
			practice it, and be able to create those kinds of joyful experiences myself.
		</p>
		<p>
			What draws me to garden3D is the sense that it‚Äôs a place where those details matter. A place
			where people care, where delight is taken seriously, and where I could work with others who
			feel the same. So I‚Äôm placing a bet. A bet that this is a team I can collaborate with to chase
			that same goal. It sounds corny, but I really believe work--both in how it‚Äôs done and what it
			creates--can and should spark joy. I want to be around people who feel that too, who get
			energised by it, and who build great things together.
