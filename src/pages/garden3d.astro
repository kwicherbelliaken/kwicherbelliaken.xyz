		<h2>Why Am I Applying?</h2>
		<p>
			I‚Äôm applying because of all the content you‚Äôve shared online and how openly you show how
			things work at your company. It started with me reading and nodding along. By the end, I was
			full-on head banging.
		</p>
		<p>
			It‚Äôs a real letdown and bugbear of mine that we spend the lions' share of our waking lives in
			workplaces that so often starve us of the things that make life worthwhile: creativity,
			community, purpose, and joy. Sure, everything‚Äôs a spectrum. Some places are better than
			others. But too often even the <em>good</em> ones often miss the mark because they confuse <em
				>on paper</em
			> corporate lip service and buzzwords for real culture.
		</p>
		<p>
			This happens because they haven‚Äôt done the work of truly figuring out what they stand for,
			what their identity is, their ethics and moral customs, its philosophies that motivate and
			steer and the politics that guide it. It‚Äôs rare enough for an individual to do that kind of
			deep, sweeping, identity work. It‚Äôs even rarer for a company to lift the veil and do it
			honestly. That‚Äôs why so many fail to create cultures that actually mean what they say, ones
			that walk the talk.
		</p>
		<p>
			What excited me about garden3d is that, from all impressions, it <em>has</em> done that work, that
			raw soul searching. I thought: <em
				>this is a place that gets it, where so many others don't</em
			>. A group that‚Äôs had the hard, confronting and honest conversations and come out the other
			side with something clear and real: a <a

				data-astro-prefetch
				href="https://garden3d.substack.com/p/our-moral-compass"
				target="_blank">moral compass</a
			>, a <a
				class="kwicherbelliaken-link underline-offset-2 sm:py-0 sm:hover:underline"
				data-astro-prefetch
				href="https://garden3d.substack.com/p/garden3d-dei-report-2024"
				target="_blank">commitment to maturing with your values</a
			>. When I read what you‚Äôve shared publicly, it felt like a beacon for people like me who‚Äôve
			been missing that kind of clarity and authenticity.
		</p>
		<p>
			I value many of the same things you do. It amazes me that most workplaces don't practice these
			values, if not for the sole and selfish benefit of their bottom line. Because surprise,
			surprise: when people aren‚Äôt treated like just another resource to be bought and spent, when
			they feel respected, heard, and empowered to bring ideas, voice concerns, and speak honestly
			without fear of being shut down, they care more. And when people care, the quality of their
			work reflects that.
		</p>
		<p>
			This mindset‚Äîthis commitment to capital T Trust‚Äîruns through everything you write. You say the
			only way to get people to truly care is to give them ‚Äúautonomy, respect, and real ownership
			over the work they do,‚Äù and that comes through clearly in <a
				class="kwicherbelliaken-link underline-offset-2 sm:py-0 sm:hover:underline"
				data-astro-prefetch
				href="https://garden3d.substack.com/p/managing-is-a-makers-skill"
				target="_blank"><em>Managing is a Maker‚Äôs Skill</em></a
			>, where you explain why you hire <a

				data-astro-prefetch
				href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1430-hire-managers-of-one"
				target="_blank">‚Äúmanagers of one.‚Äù</a
			> You trust people to handle ambiguity, solve problems, and make decisions, and because of that,
			they take ownership, raise their standards, and genuinely care. And when people care, the work
			is better. The same ethos shows up in how you approach <a

				data-astro-prefetch
				href="https://garden3d.substack.com/p/distributed"
				target="_blank">distributed work</a
			>: people are expected to take responsibility and speak up, not be micromanaged. Disagreements
			are welcomed, not shut down. Transparency is not a nice to have, it is core to how you
			operate. You have built a place where people can work independently, communicate openly, and
			be trusted to do great work. That is rare, and it does not happen by accident.
		</p>

		<h2>What is my Experience?</h2>
		<p>
			I‚Äôve spent most of my career in small B2B SaaS startups, with a short stint at a digital
			agency. It‚Äôs meant taking on the full spectrum of responsibilities, a full wardrobe of hats,
			and being all-across the technology stack. I've taken full ownership of features from
			discovery to delivery. I have had to do it all and do it well.
		</p>
		<p>
			This has included designing and shaping up software solutions, codifying them into
			specifications, communicating with stakeholders, fielding functional requirements, separating
			nice-to-haves from must-haves, and defining delivery constraints (like variable scope and
			fixed time). I‚Äôve run risk analyses, unpacked dependencies and trade-offs, identified feedback
			points (like early beta releases), shaped timelines, and worked out who we need feedback from,
			and what we need it on.
		</p>
		<p>
			I‚Äôve planned and phased work, chunked it into meaningful units, and sketched out broad-stroke
			architecture. I've implemented it: dividing into tasks, working in sprints, and incrementally
			moving toward the bigger vision. I‚Äôve helped make sure decisions are reversible (two-way
			doors), so we can pivot when needed, because software always involves the unknown, and it‚Äôs
			better to prototype and adapt than to believe everything can be planned up front.
		</p>
		<p>
			I‚Äôve handled deployments of serverless stacks (AWS CloudFormation abstractions), managed CI/CD
			pipelines, monitored customer friction and difficulties using telemetry tools like New Relic
			and FullStory, and driven engagement with platforms like Intercom. On the frontend, I‚Äôve
			shipped modern web apps using React, TypeScript, React Query, and Tailwind, with mature
			testing practices built around React Testing Library and Mock Service Worker.
		</p>
		<p>
			Mentoring has been a regular part of my job. I did this primarily through pair programming,
			where I placed a strong emphasis on developing a shared understanding. For me, it was crucial
			that we didn‚Äôt proceed unless everyone involved felt comfortable and confident in their grasp
			of the problem space. I focused less on the implementation details, the how, and more on the
			why: the reasoning, constraints, and trade-offs that shaped the work. When you achieve
			alignment at that level, there‚Äôs far less need to actively manage delivery because the team is
			already moving toward a shared vision. That clarity eliminates a lot of wasted time and
			miscommunication later down the line.
		</p>
		<p>
			I have a lot of experience operating in high-trust, self-managing environments, with real
			ownership over the final product. From interpreting the business need to setting the padding
			on the button.
		</p>

		<h2>What Goals Do I Have?</h2>
		<p>
			It‚Äôs hard to put a label on it, but if I had to, I‚Äôd say I want to become an expert in
			delivering joy through digital experiences. I know that sounds vague. But every now and then,
			you come across a digital experience that genuinely delights you, and it‚Äôs no accident. Those
			moments are designed, engineered, and intentional. I want to get better at that, study it,
			practice it, and be able to create those kinds of joyful experiences myself.
		</p>
		<p>
			What draws me to garden3D is the sense that it‚Äôs a place where those details matter. A place
			where people care, where delight is taken seriously, and where I could work with others who
			feel the same. So I‚Äôm placing a bet. A bet that this is a team I can collaborate with to chase
			that same goal. It sounds corny, but I really believe work--both in how it‚Äôs done and what it
			creates--can and should spark joy. I want to be around people who feel that too, who get
			energised by it, and who build great things together.
		</p>

		<h2>What I Value</h2>
		<p>
			These points are relevant because they articulate the core values I have and environmental
			factors that enable me to be an engaged, high-performing, and impactful team member. They
			aren‚Äôt ranked in any particular order.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Challenge.</li>
			<li>Collaboration.</li>
			<li>Alignment.</li>
			<li>Trust.</li>
			<li>Communication.</li>
			<li>Product Mindset.</li>
			<li>Supported Growth.</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>1. Challenge</h3>
		<p>
			This is two-fold. For me to stay engaged in my work, I need a fight, a mission. There has to be
			something I‚Äôm working toward, a clear objective that focuses my efforts. This naturally ties
			into alignment and collaboration, which I talk about later. I think most people would agree
			that without a challenge, it‚Äôs easy to become uninspired. For me to thrive, I need to feel
			like I‚Äôm constantly learning, growing, and not plateauing. I do best in an environment where
			growth is ongoing and real.
		</p>
		<p>
			The second part is that I like being challenged by my colleagues. The best solutions come from
			critically examining whatever‚Äôs on the table. That doesn‚Äôt mean being harsh, quite the
			opposite. I don‚Äôt enjoy cultures where critique feels personal or unkind; that only leads to
			defensiveness and limits good ideas, which limits the quality of the solution. But when
			openness is encouraged and there‚Äôs a safe space for critique, that‚Äôs when growth happens.
			Someone might raise a point I missed, or push me to defend an idea, which often reveals blind
			spots or shaky assumptions. Sometimes I might be pushing hard for something simply because it
			feels urgent to me, but I might not have the full picture. It‚Äôs through challenge and
			collaboration that better, more balanced decisions emerge. Being challenged helps sharpen
			ideas and get to the heart of the problem.
		</p>

		<h3>2. Collaboration</h3>
		<p>
			This is huge for me. While my preferences aren‚Äôt ranked, collaboration is definitely near the
			top. There‚Äôs nothing better than that gizmodic energy of working through a problem with
			someone you can dork out with, pushing boundaries and feeding off each other‚Äôs excitement.
			Problems are best tackled together. No one is a perfect idea machine or a flawless executor.
			The best solutions come through collaboration and consensus.
		</p>
		<p>
			I love spitballing with someone and feeling that infectious momentum when you‚Äôre really making
			progress. When you team up, you cover each other‚Äôs blind spots and move faster, smarter. This
			naturally ties into alignment and communication, collaboration unlocks far more potential than
			going it alone.
		</p>

		<h3>3. Alignment</h3>
		<p>
			It‚Äôs essential to me that there‚Äôs strong alignment and a shared understanding of the company
			vision, a general sense of onboardness. Without that, it‚Äôs hard to make good decisions or build
			solid solutions, because there‚Äôs no clear direction guiding them. Without an overarching
			theme, you‚Äôre never quite sure if what you‚Äôre building actually solves the right problem. The
			clarity and coherence of any solution is directly tied to how clear the company‚Äôs mission and
			goals are.
		</p>

		<h3>4. Trust</h3>
		<p>
			This is about autonomy, the freedom to act. I don‚Äôt mean going rogue, but working in a culture
			that encourages people to do the right thing. If that space isn‚Äôt there, people won‚Äôt act on
			their good instincts, even when they‚Äôre aligned and communicating well. Trusting your team
			increases velocity. Instead of waiting for approval, they use their initiative, and the work
			moves with a better rhythm and momentum.
		</p>

		<h3>5. Communication</h3>
		<p>
			Clear communication is infinitely important and incredibly underrated. I want to work where
			it's extremely valued and bad communication is actively checked. Bad communication causes many
			problems: misled expectations, misinterpreting customer pain points, lack of alignment on
			vision, and wasting time with unthought-out questions.
		</p>
		<p>
			I value a workplace where communicating well is a rehearsed art, where you consider your
			audience and adjust your style accordingly. Be obvious about your ask to save time.
			Importantly, ask questions only after you've sensibly explored all other avenues. People
			respect effort and are more willing to help if they see you've tried.
		</p>
		<p>
			Always give appropriate, relevant context and never assume shared knowledge. Help your
			audience. Explicitness, even spoon-feeding (without condescension), sets the scene clearly and
			rarely backfires. Be clear on what you expect from your audience, including the kind of
			feedback. Without explicitness, much time can be lost through relitigation because things were
			assumed obvious.
		</p>
		<p>
			Remember, less is more; everything added dilutes. No one wants to parse a wall of text for
			meaning. Remove extraneous details and fluff. There's an art and effort to this. Ensure
			context is relevant, not unnecessary.
		</p>

		<h3>6. Product Mindset</h3>
		<p>
			This requires essential trust and autonomy. An engineer's mindset isn't about merely grabbing
			the next task from the backlog, asking no questions, and thinking no further than the
			immediate task or the user, their mind bound to the implementation level. Instead, they should
			always be able to 'swap hats' or 'telescope' their perspective on the problem (even if many
			considerations are made before features are ticketed). I want to work at a company that
			encourages this, fostering the best kind of engineers ("managers of one") and avoiding any
			"feature factory" mentality. When such individuals collaborate, the potential is endless.
		</p>

		<h3>7. Supported Growth</h3>
		<p>
			This is more of a preference, but I like being supported in my growth at work. Much of my
			career has lacked adequate resources for this, so my growth has been largely self-managed.
			While you can set your own goals and keep yourself accountable, it's much easier when these
			things are built into the culture and you have support to make your growth happen.
		</p>

		<h2>What I Don't Value</h2>
		<p>
			I dislike workspaces where ego-driven gatekeeping, excessive and slow processes, and unclear
			communication hinder collaboration and progress.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Gatekeeping.</li>
			<li>Unnecessary Process.</li>
			<li>Assumed Shared Knowledge.</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>1. Gatekeeping</h3>
		<p>
			It's frustrating when someone obstructs progress due to their insecurities, which is the
			opposite of the collaboration I highly value. It's demotivating when ideas are blocked not due
			to a lack of clarity in the proposal, but because of someone's bad day or ego preventing them
			from supporting an idea they didn't originate. Instead of encouraging and collaborating for
			mutual improvement, they dismiss it. This mirrors the mindset of those secretive about their
			IP. While sometimes justified, being guarded often just delays the inevitable; someone else
			will discover the "secret," making the original person seem foolish. This secrecy also
			forfeits the chance for reciprocal learning and collaboration. Remember, even the Colonel's
			secret recipe isn't secret anymore. It's far better to support and uplift others, as they're
			likely to return the favour.
		</p>

		<h3>2. Unnecessary Process</h3>
		<p>
			I am suspicious of excessive process, including too many meetings. Meetings about previous
			meetings to plan future meetings for decisions that could be made earlier. I believe too much
			process suits those who prefer complication or build careers from the processes they create.
			Much can be achieved with a whiteboard and messy post-its, free-form, without neglecting
			essentials like risks, trade-offs, dependencies, and release communications.
		</p>
		<p>
			Excessive process acts like bunny-hopping a car. You make a little forward progress, then
			you're forced to stop to fulfil some procedural obligation. This constant starting and
			stopping kills velocity and slows everything down.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, this isn't to say all rituals are bad. Some are incredibly valuable. For example,
			blameless post-mortems can offer crucial insights. Discovering that an error occurred due to
			poor visibility might lead a team to make a cultural shift, prioritising better including of
			telemetry tools going forward. Such rituals, when focused and effective, actually help refine
			processes rather than obstruct them.
		</p>

		<h3>3. Assumed Shared Knowledge</h3>
		<p>
			For me this is a big problem. It violates the principle or preference I have for clear
			communication. It leads to people being misaligned, thinking they're working towards the same
			goal when they're actually on different, unshared paths. The outcome of this is predictably
			negative.
