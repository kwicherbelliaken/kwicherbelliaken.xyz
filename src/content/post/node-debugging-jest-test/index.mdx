## Fixing Jest Performance Issues

We had an integration test that was repeatedly timing out. Without investigating, we just kept bumping the timeout for the test suite‚Äîuntil it got both too ridiculous and too lazy to keep doing. Eventually, individual test suites were taking longer than 20 seconds to run.

<TLDRSection>

**üîç Root Causes**:

- The `amazon-cognito-identity-js` library, used to resolve access tokens, was eating 29% of execution time.
- The TypeScript compiler was hogging an equal share of execution time.

**‚ö° Solutions**:

- Replaced `amazon-cognito-identity-js` by loading authentication credentials as environment variables.
- Configured the TypeScript compiler to skip type checking and focus solely on transpilation to JavaScript.

üéâ **Results:**

- 90% reduction in test time.

</TLDRSection>

## The Problem

I had an integration test that was taking, on occasion, longer than 20s to run. That's not just slow, it was breaking our CI pipeline and developer workflow.

```text
 FAIL  __integrationTests__/api/get-summary.test.ts (15.599 s)
  Account Summary API
    ‚úï returns the correct account information (5004 ms)
```

The test itself was straightforward:

```javascript title="integration.test.js"
import frisby from "frisby";

import { getToken } from "../../getToken";

describe("Account Summary API", () => {
	it("returns the correct account information", async () => {
		const expectedAccountSummary = {
			accountId: "abc123",
			accountName: "Demo Account",
		};

		const authToken = await getToken();

		const response = await frisby
			.get("https://api.example.com/accounts/abc123/summary", {
				headers: {
					Authorization: `Bearer ${authToken}`,
				},
			})
			.promise();

		expect(response.status).toBe(200);
		expect(response.json).toEqual(expectedAccountSummary);
	});
});
```

## Diagnosing The Problem

In order to get an accurate picture of what was causing the test to timeout I made use of the Node debugger and profiler.

### Collecting The Data

I got the original influence from [Profiling a jest test with the Chrome DevTools performance profiler](https://www.youtube.com/@KentCDodds-vids).

```text
node --cpu-prof --inspect ./node_modules/jest-cli/bin/jest.js --runInBand
```

Which I passed the path to my relevant Jest configuration and the specific test I wanted to run:

```text
node --cpu-prof --inspect ./node_modules/jest-cli/bin/jest.js --config=jest.integration.config.js --runInBand __integrationTests__/api/get-summary.test.ts
```

And, finally, I ran it with my AWS credentials loaded via AWS Vault:

```text
aws-vault exec conqa -- node --cpu-prof --inspect ./node_modules/jest-cli/bin/jest.js --config=jest.integration.config.js --runInBand __integrationTests__/api/get-summary.test.ts
```

But, how do I collect a profile?

**1. Open the Dedicated Node DevTools**

Visit `chrome://inspect` in your browser and open the dedicated DevTools for Node.

<CaptionedImage
	src={openingNodeDevtools}
	alt="Chrome DevTools inspect page showing Node.js debugging interface"
	caption="Opening the dedicated Node DevTools by visiting chrome://inspect"
/>

**2. Run The Node Profile Script**

Run the script and pause the debugger immediately after it starts executing.

Alternatively, if you run the tests in watch mode, you can skip pausing the debugger. Just start the profiler as shown below, then save your test file to trigger a re-run ‚Äî the profiler will capture a profile from the test run. It's worth noting that when profiling a test in watch mode, the profiler will also capture a lot of idle time that Jest spends waiting, which can clutter the results.

**3. Start The Profiler in Node DevTools**

<CaptionedImage
	src={startNodeProfiler}
	alt="Node DevTools profiler interface showing the start profiling button"
	caption="Starting the profiler in Node DevTools to capture performance data"
/>

Start the script, then switch to your IDE where the debugger is paused and click play. After it finishes running, go back to DevTools and stop the recording ‚Äî you'll now have your profile.

### Analysing The Data

#### amazon-cognito-identity-js

From the flame graph below, we can see that the test function ran twice. I am not sure why this is the case. Importantly, is that the time the test took to execute was minimal 44ms of the total ~28s execution time.

<CaptionedImage
	src={analysingAmazonCognitoInDevtools}
	alt="Chrome DevTools flame graph showing test function execution times"
	caption="Flame graph analysis showing minimal test execution time (44ms) compared to total execution time (~28s)"
/>

If we drill into the first invocation of the test function, we can see a `getToken` (`getIdToken`) call. However, like its parent function, it only took 44ms to resolve. So how could this token resolution be causing the test to timeout?

<CaptionedImage
	src={analysingGetTokenCallInDevtools}
	alt="Chrome DevTools showing detailed analysis of getToken call execution"
	caption="Detailed view of the getToken call showing it resolved in 44ms within the test function"
/>

If we zoom out to view the full profile and search for `getIdToken`, we see it's called twice ‚Äî and the second call takes up a significant amount of time on the main thread. But this doesn't really tell us what the underlying issue is. Why is the getIdToken call taking so long?

<CaptionedImage
	src={analysingMultipleGetTokenCallsInDevtools}
	alt="Chrome DevTools profile view showing multiple getIdToken calls with performance impact"
	caption="Full profile view revealing getIdToken is called twice, with the second call consuming significant main thread time"
/>

Back in the summary tab, we can see that a large part of the main thread is taken up by `@conqa/get-access-token` and `amazon-cognito-identity-js`. The `getToken` module, which our test imports, uses `@conqa/get-access-token`, which in turn depends on `amazon-cognito-identity-js`. Together they take up 29.1% of the total execution time.

<CaptionedImage
	src={amazonCognitoAsCulpritInDevtools}
	alt="Chrome DevTools summary tab highlighting amazon-cognito-identity-js as performance culprit"
	caption="Summary tab revealing amazon-cognito-identity-js and @conqa/get-access-token consuming 29.1% of total execution time"
/>

I further confirmed this finding when I uploaded the same `.cpuprofile` into more insight driven tools [speedscope](https://github.com/jlfwong/speedscope#usage) and [cpupro](https://discoveryjs.github.io/cpupro/#).

Using the Left Heavy view in speedscope I confirmed that the `amazon-cognito-identity-js` library was contributing heavily to the overall execution time. The Left Heavy view:

	alt="Speedscope Left Heavy view showing amazon-cognito-identity-js contributing heavily to execution time"
	caption="Speedscope Left Heavy view confirming amazon-cognito-identity-js library's heavy contribution to overall execution time"
/>

I found an even more illustrative picture of this imbalance using cpupro. Bang! Right there! At the top of the list of packages using the most main thread time is `amazon-cognito-identity-js`.

<CaptionedImage
	src={cpupro}
	alt="Cpupro analysis showing amazon-cognito-identity-js at the top of main thread time usage"
	caption="Cpupro analysis clearly showing amazon-cognito-identity-js at the top of packages consuming the most main thread time"
/>

Right below `amazon-cognito-identity-js` are Jest running idle and TypeScript. This leads us to:

#### TypeScript

As others have noted, a major reason Jest tests run slowly is because the TypeScript compiler needs to convert the tests into a format Jest can run.

<CaptionedImage
	src={speedscopeTypescript}
	alt="Speedscope showing TypeScript compiler's impact on Jest test performance"
	caption="Performance analysis showing how the TypeScript compiler contributes to slow Jest test execution"
/>

In fact, much of Jest's idle time happens while TypeScript is compiling. If we start profiling after compilation is done, we see that the main cause of the slow test is the `amazon-cognito-identity-js` package.

This project uses `ts-jest`, which by default runs the full TypeScript compiler:

- It checks types.
- It resolves and checks types in imported files.
- It transpiles TypeScript to JavaScript.

Running tests is expensive, especially since Jest uses multiple workers, each with its own cache‚Äîcausing files to be recompiled unnecessarily. But even with just one test file, we noticed long compile times while idle.

So, how do we fix this? It comes down to setting boundaries on what we ask the TypeScript compiler to do. For testing, we don't always need full type checking. Instead, we can just transpile the code and skip type checks, which speeds things up‚Äîespecially when the goal is just to run the code, not verify types. This trade off is something I explore in [[Faster Tests With No Type Checking]].

## The Fix

### amazon-cognito-identity-js

The fix for this is a little too internal to expose here.

### TypeScript

As mentioned, employing the TypeScript compiler in a "do everything" mode might be our problem here. We can limit its responsibilities through setting the right configuration options. I think that is a task better tackled in a separate blog post: [Faster Tests With No Type Checking](/posts/faster-tests-with-no-type-checking/).

## Other Possibilities

The post [Jest - Tackling Performance Issues](https://dev.to/ipwright83/jest-tackling-performance-issues-105g) was a helpful starting point. It suggested that performance problems could be caused by **barrel imports** and complex module resolution. But I only had two imports, so that didn't seem relevant. It also looked into **memory leaks**, which mostly affect multiple test suites‚Äîbut I was only running one, so that wasn't it either.

Another useful article was [How I divided by ten the time of execution of my jest unit testing](https://healthtech.theodo.com/blog/how-i-divided-by-ten-the-time-of-execution-of-my-jest-unit-testing). It blamed slow tests on using **real timers** and on **TypeScript compilation**. The author recommended skipping type checking during tests by enabling "isolatedModules": true in `ts-jest`, and doing type checks separately in CI or pre-commit.

In my case, I wasn't using barrel imports, timers, or running multiple test suites But, as noticed, it does seem that TypeScript compilation was a big contributor to slowness.
