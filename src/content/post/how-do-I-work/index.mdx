## What is This?

This captures how I work and what I look for in a workplace. I think it’s more useful than a résumé, it gives a clearer view of my values and working style.

[W.D.G.W.L.L](/posts/wdgll/) gives a framework for how sticking to these points produces good work. Taken together, these notes form the basis for a complete theory of effective work.

### What I Value

These points are relevant because they articulate the core values I have and environmental factors that enable me to be an engaged, high-performing, and impactful team member. They aren’t ranked in any particular order.

1. Challenge.
2. Collaboration.
3. Alignment.
4. Trust.
5. Communication.
6. Product Mindset.
7. Supported Growth.

#### 1. Challenge

This is two-fold. For me to stay engaged in my work, I need a fight: a mission. There has to be something I'm working toward, a clear objective that focuses my efforts. This naturally ties into alignment and collaboration, which I talk about later. I think most people would agree that without a challenge, it’s easy to become uninspired. For me to thrive, I need to feel like I’m constantly learning, growing, and not plateauing. I do best in an environment where growth is ongoing and real.

The second part is that I like being challenged by my colleagues. The best solutions come from critically examining whatever's on the table. That doesn't mean being harsh; quite the opposite. I don’t enjoy cultures where critique feels personal or unkind; that only leads to defensiveness and limits good ideas, which limits the quality of the solution. But when openness is encouraged and there’s a safe space for critique, that’s when growth happens. Someone might raise a point I missed, or push me to defend an idea, which often reveals blind spots or shaky assumptions. Sometimes I might be pushing hard for something simply because it feels urgent to me—but I might not have the full picture. It’s through challenge and collaboration that better, more balanced decisions emerge. Being challenged helps sharpen ideas and get to the heart of the problem.

#### 2. Collaboration

This is huge for me. While my preferences aren’t ranked, collaboration is definitely near the top. There's nothing better than that gizmodic energy of working through a problem with someone you can dork out with, pushing boundaries and feeding off each other's excitement. Problems are best tackled together. No one is a perfect idea machine or a flawless executor. The best solutions come through collaboration and consensus.

I love spitballing with someone and feeling that infectious momentum when you’re really making progress. When you team up, you cover each other’s blind spots and move faster, smarter. This naturally ties into alignment and communication—collaboration unlocks far more potential than going it alone.

#### 3. Alignment

It's essential to me that there's strong alignment and a shared understanding of the company vision, a general sense of onboardness. Without that, it’s hard to make good decisions or build solid solutions, because there’s no clear direction guiding them. Without an overarching theme, you’re never quite sure if what you’re building actually solves the right problem. The clarity and coherence of any solution is directly tied to how clear the company’s mission and goals are.

#### 4. Trust

This is about autonomy: the freedom to act. I don’t mean going rogue, but working in a culture that encourages people to do the right thing. If that space isn’t there, people won’t act on their good instincts—even when they’re aligned and communicating well. Trusting your team increases velocity. Instead of waiting for approval, they use their initiative, and the work moves with a better rhythm and momentum.

#### 5. Communication

Clear communication is infinitely important and incredibly underrated. I want to work where it's extremely valued and bad communication is actively checked. Bad communication causes many problems: misled expectations, misinterpreting customer pain points, lack of alignment on vision, and wasting time with unthought-out questions.

I value a workplace where communicating well is a rehearsed art, where you consider your audience and adjust your style accordingly. Be obvious about your ask to save time. Importantly, ask questions only after you've sensibly explored all other avenues. People respect effort and are more willing to help if they see you've tried.

Always give appropriate, relevant context and never assume shared knowledge. Help your audience. Explicitness, even spoon-feeding (without condescension), sets the scene clearly and rarely backfires. Be clear on what you expect from your audience, including the kind of feedback. Without explicitness, much time can be lost through relitigation because things were assumed obvious.

Remember, less is more; everything added dilutes. No one wants to parse a wall of text for meaning. Remove extraneous details and fluff. There's an art and effort to this. Ensure context is relevant, not unnecessary.

#### 6. Product Mindset

This requires essential trust and autonomy. An engineer's mindset isn't about merely grabbing the next task from the backlog, asking no questions, and thinking no further than the immediate task or the user, their mind bound to the implementation level. Instead, they should always be able to 'swap hats' or 'telescope' their perspective on the problem, even if many considerations are made before features are ticketed. I want to work at a company that encourages this, fostering the best kind of engineers ('managers of one') and avoiding any 'feature factory' mentality. When such individuals collaborate, the potential is endless.

#### 7. Supported Growth

This is more of a preference, but I like being supported in my growth at work. Much of my career has lacked adequate resources for this, so my growth has been largely self-managed. While you can set your own goals and keep yourself accountable, it's much easier when these things are built into the culture and you have support to make your growth happen.

### What I Don't Value

I dislike workspaces where ego-driven gatekeeping, excessive and slow processes, and unclear communication hinder collaboration and progress.

1. Gatekeeping.
2. Unnecessary Process.
3. Assumed Shared Knowledge.

#### 1. Gatekeeping

It's frustrating when someone obstructs progress due to their insecurities, which is the opposite of the collaboration I highly value. It's demotivating when ideas are blocked not due to a lack of clarity in the proposal, but because of someone's bad day or ego preventing them from supporting an idea they didn't originate. Instead of encouraging and collaborating for mutual improvement, they dismiss it. This mirrors the mindset of those secretive about their IP. While sometimes justified, being guarded often just delays the inevitable; someone else will discover the "secret," making the original person seem foolish. This secrecy also forfeits the chance for reciprocal learning and collaboration. Remember, even the Colonel's secret recipe isn't secret anymore. It's far better to support and uplift others, as they're likely to return the favour.

#### 2. Unnecessary Process

I am suspicious of excessive process, including too many meetings: meetings about previous meetings to plan future meetings for decisions that could be made earlier. I believe too much process suits those who prefer complication or build careers from the processes they create. Much can be achieved with a whiteboard and messy post-its, free-form, without neglecting essentials like risks, trade-offs, dependencies, and release communications.

Excessive process acts like bunny-hopping a car: you make a little forward progress, then you're forced to stop to fulfil some procedural obligation. This constant starting and stopping kills velocity and slows everything down.

However, this isn't to say all rituals are bad. Some are incredibly valuable. For example, blameless post-mortems can offer crucial insights. Discovering that an error occurred due to poor visibility might lead a team to make a cultural shift, prioritising better including of telemetry tools going forward. Such rituals, when focused and effective, actually help refine processes rather than obstruct them.

#### 3. Assumed Shared Knowledge

For me this is a big problem. It violates the principle or preference I have for clear communication. It leads to people being misaligned, thinking they're working towards the same goal when they're actually on different, unshared paths. The outcome of this is predictably negative.
