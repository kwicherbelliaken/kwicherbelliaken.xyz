## The Brief

I was creating a multiplayer, browser based minefield-esque game, where users take turns guessing where a programmatically placed dot has rendered on a canvas. With this project, I wanted to try something different. Instead of using a framework to do my bidding, I wanted to rent a server that I could host my back and frontend on.

**This is the technology stack I went with:**

```text
// The core stack.
- Web: TypeScript, Vite, React.
- Nginx for handling SSL, reverse proxying, and load balancing (VPS only).
```

## Implementation

I already had a Digital Ocean Droplet set up. It was where I was running my backend.

### 1. Clone Github Repository Onto Droplet

In order to do this, I needed to generate an SSH key and add the public key to my Github repository. I followed the steps outlined in [Step 4 :- Clone your private repository from GitHub to Server](https://the-shubham.medium.com/how-to-clone-your-private-git-repository-and-deploy-on-digitalocean-your-node-js-application-with-217772f18c95). I named the public key _where-the-dot-client-deploy-key_ because I needed to distinguish between it and another SSH key that I was using to access my server Git repository.

**When using multiple repositories on a single server, it is required that you use different SSH keys to access each one of your repositories.** This sensible requirement is explained in [Using multiple repositories on one server](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/managing-deploy-keys#using-multiple-repositories-on-one-server), screenshot below.

This was the entry in my `ssh.config` for my client repository:

```cli
Host github.com-where-the-dot-client
  Hostname github.com
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/where-the-dot-client-deploy-key
```

This was my `ssh.config` in full:

```text
Host github.com-where-the-dot-client
  Hostname github.com
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/where-the-dot-client-deploy-key

Host github.com-where-the-dot-server
  Hostname github.com
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/where-the-dot-server-deploy-key
```

### 2. Setting Nginx as a Reverse Proxy

For my domain `wherethedot.com`, I needed Nginx to serve my client application. This required adding a server block to my Nginx configuration and copying my applications' build files to Nginxs' web directory.

I found a helpful resource in [How To Deploy a React Application with Nginx on Ubuntu](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/deploy-react-application-with-nginx-on-ubuntu).

```nginx ins={12,13}
# HTTP to HTTPS redirect for main domain
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name wherethedot.com www.wherethedot.com;
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}

# Main domain - React client
server {
    listen 443 ssl;

    root /var/www/wherethedot.com/html;
    index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

    server_name wherethedot.com www.wherethedot.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/cloudflare_origin_cert.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/cloudflare_origin_key.pem;

    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;

    # Static files (CSS, JS, images, etc.)
    location ~* \.(js|css|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|ico|svg|woff|woff2|ttf|eot)$ {
        expires 1y;
        add_header Cache-Control "public, immutable";
        try_files $uri =404;
    }

    # React Router - serve index.html for all other routes
    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }
}
```

After each client rebuild, I needed to copy the build files to Nginxs' web directory. [Deploy React & Node.js with HTTPS on Digital Ocean and Netlify - Part 19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nEAmUdAPV4) was a helpful resource during this part of the process.

```text
// Run command inside client directory (cd ~/where-the-dot-client)
cp -r ./dist/* /var/www/wherethedot.com/html
```

It is important to validate and restart Nginx each time you make an edit to its configuration.

```bash
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

## Other Considerations

I realised that I did not need to host my client code on the Droplet. All I needed was the build output. I could use SFTP to upload builds to the Droplet directly.

Alternatively, instead of serving static build files, I could configure Nginx as a reverse proxy to forward requests to a locally running instance of my React application (served from a local development server). This is the approach explained in [Deploy React & Node.js with HTTPS on Digital Ocean and Netlify - Part 19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nEAmUdAPV4).
