## The Problem

While writing tests for a project, I hit a snag when importing a function from the [jose](https://github.com/panva/jose) library—a modern, ESM-only crypto toolkit.

```typescript title="test.tsx"
import { compactDecrypt } from "jose";
```

When running the test, Jest threw an error.

## Understanding The Root Cause

The cause of this error is pretty simple. Jest does not have native support for interpreting ES modules, which `jose` is distributed as.

### Why Jest Needs Transformers

Jest needs transformers like `babel` or `ts-jest` to run JSX, TypeScript, and newer JavaScript syntax (features). Setting them up properly often requires extra plugins or presets. Jest relies on these transformers to preprocess files before execution:

This transformation can also be required for taking newer ES6 syntax and compiling it down to a format that Jest and the Node JS runtime it operates in to an interpretable format

1. **JSX:** JSX syntax (used in React) isn't valid JavaScript and needs to be transformed into standard JavaScript function calls before execution.
2. **TypeScript:** Must be transpiled to JavaScript.
3. **Modern JavaScript (ES6+):** > New syntax supports features like async/await and optional chaining, but not all runtimes understand it. So it's important to use a transformer that compiles it down into a format that Jest and the Node runtime it operates in can interpret.
4. **ES Modules:** Different module resolution strategies. The way modules are resolved brings in modern syntax (like import/export) that the runtime might not understand directly — which is why a transformer is needed.
5. **Non-JS Assets:** Static assets like images, icons.

By default, transformers ignore files in node_modules because most libraries provide a CommonJS build. But some, like `jose`, do not make this affordance--which causes the error above.

## The Fix

### Step 1: Configure Transformers To Handle ESM Library

To fix this, we tell the transformers to process `jose` much the same as they do our own application code.

The first change we needed to make was in our `jest.config.js`, where we told `ts-jest`, Jest's transpile or transform tool, to **not** ignore the `jose` dependency and to process it.

```javascript title="jest.config.js" ins={4}
module.exports = {
  preset: 'ts-jest',
  ...,
  transformIgnorePatterns: ['/node_modules/(?!(jose)/)'],
  ...,
};
```

### Step 2: Use The Right Preset For JavaScript

By default, `ts-jest` doesn't process JavaScript files. But all our `node_modules` are bundled as JavaScript—just in varying formats like CommonJS or ESM, and with different syntax. So, we needed a preset that supports compiling JavaScript files.

```javascript title="jest.config.js" ins={4}
module.exports = {
  preset: 'ts-jest/presets/js-with-ts',
  ...,
  transformIgnorePatterns: ['/node_modules/(?!(jose)/)'],
  ...,
};
```

### Step 3: Configure TypeScript To Process JavaScript Files

Finally, to make this work, we needed to configure the TypeScript compiler (used by `ts-jest`) to also process JavaScript files.

```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    ...,
    "allowJs": true
  },
  ...,
}
```

## Summary

So, in summary, for Jest to be able to handle ESM libraries we needed to:

1. **Explicitly told Jest** which ESM libraries need transformation.
2. **Used the right preset** that can handle both TypeScript and JavaScript files.
3. **Configured TypeScript** to process JavaScript files from node_modules.
