## The Problem

I initially set up my project with a CSS reset that applied a maximum width to the body element:

```css title="global.css"
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

@layer base {
	body {
		@apply ... max-w-3xl;
	}
}
```

This worked well for most pages, but created an issue on my landing page where I needed the content to span the full width.

## Attempts

**1. Overriding The Width Locally**

This was a failed attempt. My first instinct was to override the max width in my landing page component:

```astro title="index.astro"
<style>
	:global(body) {
		max-width: 100%;
	}
</style>
```

While this worked in my local development environment, it failed in production. The global stylesheet seemed to take precedence over my local styles, _somewhat_ contradicting Astro's documentation which states:

> When conflicting styles are defined both globally and in a page’s local `<style>` tag, the local styles should overwrite any global styles. (But, there can be other factors involved, so always visually inspect your site to make sure your styles are properly applied!)
>
> [Add site wide styling](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/2-pages/5/)

**2. Conditional Styling Off HTML Attribute**

This worked. It involved dynamically setting an HTML data attribute on the body element as high up in the page as possible. I did this in my base layout component.

```html title="Base.astro"
---
const currentPath = Astro.url.pathname;
const isHomePage = currentPath === "/";
---

<body data-page={isHomePage ? "home" : "default"} />
```

Then in my global CSS, I modified the styling to apply the max-width to all pages _except_ the home page:

```css title="global.css"
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

@layer base {
	body {
		@apply ... max-w-full;
	}

	/* Apply max-width to all pages except home/landing page */
	body:not([data-page="home"]) {
		@apply max-w-3xl;
	}
}
```
